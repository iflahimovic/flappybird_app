Mobile Applications 2 - Flappybird App

Together we developed a mobile application in the 5th semester. 
Our task was to develop an app that presents content in a playful way. 
After an initial unsuitable app idea, we decided to develop the Flappybird app ourselves.

During our work together, we learned a lot of new things.  
Not only did we work with the software applications Confluence, GitHub and
Trello, but above all we were able to gain new impressions in joint app development.

Our two biggest learnings are that failed ideas are not a broken leg and 
that it makes perfect sense to use game engines in game development.
